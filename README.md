# What is it
quick adaption for xrdp login screen

## How to use
when xrdp is installed and running, just copy the files to the filesystem, take a backup of your initial xrdp.ini just to be safe. xrdp.service has to be restarted to take effect, I normally go with a reboot when making changes

## Logo
The logo is 240 x 220, you can put your own image there. Should be 24bit and if renamed, change the path in xrdp.ini to match your new file
